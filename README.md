# DNA GC Content Calculator

A Streamlit-powered web application for calculating nucleotide composition (A, T, G, C) and GC content percentage of DNA sequences. This tool supports batch input, file uploads (CSV/FASTA), result export to Excel, and includes sequence validation with visual feedback.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Context
This project was developed as part of a research initiative under the guidance of **Prof. Alexander Koffman** and **Dr. Long Ma**, with contributions from other authors. It aims to simplify nucleotide-level analysis and visualize genetic data efficiently in genomics workflows.

## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… Supports multiple DNA sequence entries via manual input
- âœ… Upload DNA sequences via CSV or FASTA files
- âœ… Calculates:
  - A, T, G, C base counts
  - Base percentages
  - GC content %
- âœ… Excel file generation of results
- âœ… Interactive charts and visualizations
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization
- âœ… Simple, modern UI via Streamlit

## ðŸ§ª How to Run
